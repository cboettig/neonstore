Description: The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) provides access
  to its numerous data products through its REST API, 
  <https://data.neonscience.org/data-api/>. This package provides a
  high-level user interface for downloading and storing NEON data products.
  Unlike 'neonUtilities', this package will avoid repeated downloading,
  provides persistent storage, and improves performance.  'neonstore' can also
  construct a local 'duckdb' database of stacked tables, making it possible
  to work with tables that are far to big to fit into memory.
